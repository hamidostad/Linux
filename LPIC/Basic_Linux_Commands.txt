1. Install the sysstat package using the following command for a Debian-based distribution:
$ sudo apt-get install sysstat
We can also use the following command for a RHEL-based distribution:
$ sudo yum install sysstat
2. Edit the /etc/default/sysstat file with your favorite text editor and change the following value from:
ENABLED="false"
To:
ENABLED="true"
3. Restart the sysstat service using the following command:
$ sudo service sysstat restart
4. By default, sar stats are collected every 10 minutes. The data is collected using a simple cron job configured within /etc/cron.d/sysstat. This job can be amended to collect the data as frequently as you require.
5. Use the following command to view basic CPU statistics, including wait times:
sar -u
6. Use the following command to view the available memory statistics:
sar -r
7. Seeing the IO stats for individual block devices can be helpful when tracking down performance issues. You can use the following command to view these statistics with sar:
sar -b
